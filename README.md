# CeeCalc
Another original calculator, this time in C! Expect this to be copied to literally every other langugage i can learn

# Install
If on x86 win32/64 or linux 32/64 or macos 14/15/26+ (intel or silicon), you can grab a binary from releases<br>
Or you can clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/polecatttt/CeeCalc.git`) (`gh repo clone polecatttt/CeeCalc`)<br>
Note: I compiled with `gcc -lm -Iinclude -o ceecalc src/*.c` (lm needed since math.h, Iinclude to show include directory)<br>

# Thank you to
polecat for giving me this amazing idea
